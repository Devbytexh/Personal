            <p class="description">I started learning on how to code in my first year in college. At first i didn't take it 
                that serouis because I was going for electrical engineering at first, however I see the opportunity i could have 
                as a front end dev. The ability to build wonderfull Webpage/Website for myself, for other people and potentially for small business and maybe big ones also.
                I have built Ecomers, business card, portfolio, resume with HTLM and CSS.

            <p class="clear">In the days I'm not building Website/webpage, I'm mostly watchinbg movies, listening to music and play 
                video game. Favorite movies genre is: Fantasy, crime, comedie and horror. For music don't have a favorite it depend on what i'm feeling for the day.
